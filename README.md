# Social-Media-Website
A mock social-media-style website created for the Group Project module in second year computer science. Working as a team of 6, a functional and responsive website was created utilising HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and a MySQL Database. As well as the site, two reports were collaboratively written, one during the WIP/Planning stage and one during the evaluative process. Designs such as wireframes were also made and a presentation was given demonstrating the website. This work was graded at a 1st class overall.
